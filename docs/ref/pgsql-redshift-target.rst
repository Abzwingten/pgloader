Migrating a PostgreSQL Database to Redshift
===========================================

This command instructs pgloader to load data from a database connection.
Automatic discovery of the schema is supported, including build of the
indexes, primary and foreign keys constraints. A default set of casting
rules are provided and might be overloaded and appended to by the command.


TODO: add details about S3 credentials and bucket configuration.
